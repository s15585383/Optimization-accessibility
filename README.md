  -This document represents the changes and adaptations for the site for a more browser friendly development
  and accessible for people with disabilities

  -Syntax within the starter code needed to be renamed, most elements were inputed as "Div".
  With this in mind, new diversified elements that represent correctly each segment of the code were implemented 
  in place of the "Div".

  -Clear comments describing each segment of the code, where it starts to where it ends were added, and also 
  what each segment is used for, for easier access and readability

  Segments in the code that were changed are described in comments within the code but some described below:
   - title changed to Horiseon in the head segment
